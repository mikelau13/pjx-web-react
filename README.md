## Running bash commands from the container

Please run all bash(terminal) related commands from the `pjx-web-react-dev` container. This includes:

- Installing new npm modules
- Generating types
- Pretty much all the scripts commands in the package.json file

The one exception to this rule is the below command that will open an interactive terminal for the `pjx-web-react-dev` container. Once in this interactive terminal you can now run your commands the same as you would from your local terminal.

```bash
# run from your computer's terminal
npm run docker:exec
```

If successful you should see the following in your termianl:

```bash
# This is showing me logged in as root user.
root@2lsk39bd:/usr/app
```


To exit the interactive terminal run the following:

```bash
exit
```
